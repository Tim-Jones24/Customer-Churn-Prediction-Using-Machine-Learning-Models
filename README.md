# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
This project explores the prediction of customer churn using various machine learning models, selecting the best performing model for accurate predictions. The dataset contains 9 features including customer tenure, services, biliing details, and the target variable, #### Churn.


### Workflow:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Data visualization and feature analysis to understand patterns and correlations.

2. Model Selection:
* Implemnted and evaluated four machine algorithms:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random FOREST
* Gradient Boosting

* Random Forest achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 94.19%, making it the chosen model for predictions.

### Tools and Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
* Data Manipulation: Pandas, Numpy
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to create an efficient model that can predict whether a customer will churn, helping business implement proactive strategies to retain customers.
